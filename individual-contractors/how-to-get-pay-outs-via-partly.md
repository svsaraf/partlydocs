# How to get pay outs via Partly

So you're planning to use Partly to track your projects with clients? Great!



The main thing you want to set up is to ensure that you can get paid. That way, when a client gets a Partly invoice, the money can come straight to you.&#x20;

First start by going to your **Profile** within the Partly app. You'll see a button that says **Generate Stripe Account**. Hit it!

This will immediately create a stripe connect account for you (note that a stripe connect account on Partly is separate from other stripe accounts you may already have). Your next step is to connect the Stripe account to your bank account to receive payouts. Hit the **Wire up my Stripe Account** button.&#x20;

You'll have to then fill out all the details for your business. Yeah it's a bit of work, but it should only take 5-10 minutes.

When you return to your profile, it should tell you that your Stripe account is configured. Yay! Now you can receive payouts directly to your bank account if you send an invoice via Partly.&#x20;
