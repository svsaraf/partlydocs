# How to add a contractor

Your contractor should already have onboarded onto Partly. Tell them to go to their Profile page and locate their "Contractor PID" and have them send it to you, via email / slack / carrier pigeon.&#x20;

Once you have the PID, you can add a contractor via PID from the Contractors page in the business section. If you don't have a business section, you need to have it enabled.&#x20;
